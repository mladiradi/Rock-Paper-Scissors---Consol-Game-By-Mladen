# Rock-Paper-Scissors---Console-Game-By-Mladen
Mladen's part of console game - Rock Paper Scissors

Description and rules of the game:

      • Project title (should answer the question "What's inside this project) 
      • Project goals (what problem do we solve, e. g. we implement a certain game) 
      • Solution (should describe how we solve the problem → algorithms, technologies, libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) 
      • Source code link (give a direct link to your source code) 
      • Screenshots (add screenshots from your project in different scenarios of its usage) 
      • Live demo (add a one-click live demo of your code)

Next, write on the console what options ("r" for "rock", "p" for "paper", and "s" for "scissors") the player can choose 
from and read his input data. You already know how to do this:

Now let's run the app in the console and check whether our current code works properly:
