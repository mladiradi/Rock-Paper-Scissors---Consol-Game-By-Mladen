# Rock-Paper-Scissors---Console-Game-By-Mladen
Mladen's part of console game - Rock Paper Scissors

Description and rules of the game:

      • Project title (should answer the question "What's inside this project) 
      • Project goals (what problem do we solve, e. g. we implement a certain game) 
      • Solution (should describe how we solve the problem → algorithms, technologies, libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) 
      • Source code link (give a direct link to your source code) 
      • Screenshots (add screenshots from your project in different scenarios of its usage) 
      • Live demo (add a one-click live demo of your code)


Implement the Game Logic 
Read Player's Move 
Now let's start working on our code. 
Create three variables for our "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors", which we will use later. They should look like this:

Next, write on the console what options ("r" for "rock", "p" for "paper", and "s" for "scissors") the player can choose 
from and read his input data. You already know how to do this:

Now let's run the app in the console and check whether our current code works properly:

We can see that we have our text written on the console, and we can also write. 

Match Player's Move with Possible Options 
Now it is time to turn the user input into one of our player's moves options. To do this, create an if-else 
statement with the possible moves and change the player_move variable value with the value it represents. 
First, if the user has entered "r", they chose "Rock". Write it like this:

And if they have entered "p" or "s", then they chose "Paper" or "Scissors" accordingly. Write the else-if 
statements by yourself:
